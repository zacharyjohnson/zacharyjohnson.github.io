    <div class="case-study-body case-study---add-margin">I believe that working in groups and collaborating with others is an important aspect of creating your best work. Brainstorming, utilizing every person’s individual strengths, and coming together as a team to complete challenging work always leads to better results. That being said, working in a team involves a lot of overhead. How do you ensure everybody is on the same page? How do you divide the work in a way that everybody understands what they need to work on? Can we create a platform that ensures people are working towards the team’s goals without adding overhead?<br>‍<br>Collaborating with a group of five other CS majors, I worked on a mobile web application that tackled these issues. From conception to production, I partnered with the team’s PM, front-end developer, and back-end developers to create this platform for our CS 307: Software Engineering Class. I delivered wireframes, visual mockups, prototypes, and worked with the front-end team to ensure design specifications were being met. We worked through 3 individual, month-long sprints to create our final project.<br>‍<br>Check it out at <a href="http://team4amora.firebaseapp.org" target="_blank" class="case-study-body-link">team4amora.firebaseapp.org</a><br></div>

    <div class="case-study-inner-subtitle text-block-4">How do we facilitate group work without adding complexity?</div>
    <div class="case-study-body">We decided to work on this project because courses and clubs require continuous group collaboration, yet nobody on the team had found a service or platform that worked for truly beneficial team collaboration. Trello, Asana, and Wunderlist are unnecessarily complex. Things and Reminders don’t allow for team collaboration. Generally, no apps allow users to plan their day with meetings and tasks, nonetheless allow other group members to easily view those calendars for meeting scheduling.<br></div>
    <p class="case-study-body">To develop our solutions, our group had numerous whiteboarding and brainstorming sessions to develop an extensive list of possible ideas. We then talked with our TA’s, friends, and other groups to learn about their grievances, annoyances, and desires for a truly collaborative task tracking application.</p><img src="images/IMG_2325.jpg" srcset="images/IMG_2325-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/IMG_2325-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/IMG_2325-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/IMG_2325-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/IMG_2325-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/IMG_2325-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, images/IMG_2325-p-3200.jpeg 3200w, images/IMG_2325.jpg 4032w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 991px) 96vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">
    <p class="case-study-inner-title">Feature list</p>
    <p class="case-study-body">We used this data to refine our list into its most important, beneficial features:</p>
    <ul class="case-study-list">
      <li class="case-study-body"><strong class="bold-text-17">Separate ‘lists’ into ‘projects’</strong> - Rather than inundating groups with countless lists and sublists, we decided to implement projects. Each project has a unique set of collaborators with its own list. This separation simplifies the user experience, while also allowing for greater control over tasks.</li>
      <li class="case-study-body"><strong class="bold-text-18">Display what users need to see</strong> - In our research, we asked people what they look for when scanning through their to-do list. The most common results were importance, number of days remaining to work on it, and the title of the task. The majority of interviewees only wanted full details for a task if they select it.</li>
      <li class="case-study-body"><strong class="bold-text-19">Create ‘My Day’</strong> - We found that people like planning out their day; sectioning off portions of time to work on specific tasks helps people feel like they have control over what they work on. Therefore, we added a ‘My Day’ section where users can drag any task from any project to show what to work on, and when to work on it.</li>
      <li class="case-study-body"><strong class="bold-text-20">Create user profiles</strong> - To facilitate collaboration and meeting scheduling, any user can view any other user’s ‘My Day’ plan by clicking on their icon from anywhere in the application.</li>
      <li class="case-study-body"><strong class="bold-text-21">Customizable sorting</strong> - We discovered that different people sort their to-do lists in different ways; to accommodate this, we added sorting and filtering mechanisms that ranging from order of importance and deadline, chronological, by only deadline, or by categories assigned to tasks.</li>
      <li class="case-study-body"><strong class="bold-text-22">Implement managerial roles</strong> - Users, specifically team leaders and managers, wanted oversite to who is assigned to tasks, to confirm is a task was completed to specifications, and to control every customizable aspect of a project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="case-study-body">The conversations we had with friends, coworkers, and collaborators led us to those most important features. We entered those conversations with a curious, open, unbiased mind because we wanted it to be friendly rather than an interview so that people felt the most comfortable answering our questions. These conversations confirmed some of our assumptions, but more often than not, completely contradicted our ideas. Our goal was to create a beneficial, user-friendly experience, and these conversations were crucial to our success.</p>

      <div class="case-study-inner-title">II) Designing the product</div>
      <div class="case-study-inner-subtitle">Creating a clean, beneficial user experience and interface</div>
      <div class="case-study-body">Jakob’s Law states that “Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.” Because of this, I like to start my design process by looking for inspiration. Rather than looking through websites like Dribbble or Behance, where most designs are more creative and experimental than truly beneficial, I look at various popular websites and applications to see how they’ve tackled design problems.<br><br>For Amora, I looked predominantly at Things 3, Discord, and Spark. I chose these applications because they’re popular, well designed, and some of the cleanest, well-thought-out applications on the market.</div><img src="images/Looking-up-inspiration.png" srcset="images/Looking-up-inspiration-p-500.png 500w, images/Looking-up-inspiration-p-800.png 800w, images/Looking-up-inspiration-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Looking-up-inspiration-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Looking-up-inspiration.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">
      <div class="case-study-body">Each excelled at different things: Things 3 is incredibly simplistic to-do application. It incorporates many of our team’s wishes for the task layout, so I took note of the tasks when closed and expanded in that application.<br><br>I’ve used Discord regularly for communication and collaboration; it’s how I talk with countless friends, and I use it as a community development tool for my floor community. I think Discord has an incredibly design and user experience, so I took note of its separation of servers and invitation system for inviting people to servers.<br><br>I use Spark as my main email client. It successfully simplifies extremely complex and complicated options, actions, and call to actions into an incredibly simple user experience. It follows my team’s mantra of “be a robust application, but assume simplicity.” Because of this, I looked at and took note on how it incorporates these robust features into a simple user experience.<br></div>
      <div class="case-study-inner-title">Wireframing</div>
      <div class="case-study-body">With this inspiration, I set out on the second step of my design process: brainstorming through wireframing. This allowed me to experiment with different layouts and ways to incorporate features quickly and easily, while also keeping my development team in the loop and on the same page.</div><img src="images/Wireframes.png" srcset="images/Wireframes-p-500.png 500w, images/Wireframes-p-800.png 800w, images/Wireframes-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Wireframes-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Wireframes-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Wireframes-p-2600.png 2600w, images/Wireframes.png 3034w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">
      <div class="case-study-body">After the brainstorming, I asked myself the following questions to narrow down which mockup I want:</div>
      <ul class="case-study-list">
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">What are the user’s behaviors, goals, and expectations when using this app?</li>
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">Which of these designs best help us solve the problem of group collaboration pain points?</li>
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">How do we differentiate our design while still maintaining usability?</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="case-study-body">The leftmost bar contains the projects that a user is in. This bar is always present, allowing for simple, easy switching between projects. The next section is specific to the project. It contains the majority of information that a user will work with, and is unique to each project. Listed at the top is the name of the project, along with the setting icons. Directly below are the icons of the collaborators. Listing these at the top shows their importance and allows users to easily differentiate between their projects, while also making the project more personal and engaging; seeing the icons of your team members is a subtle reminder of who you’re working with and the importance of collaboration.<br><br>We included an announcements section with each project, and listed it next. We’re currently designing for english-speaking users, so based on the way top-down, right-left style of reading our users are accustomed to, this placement again proves the importance of announcements. They’re unique to each project to keep the separation apparent.<br><br>The final portion of this section contains the tasks. By default, they’re listed with a standard checkbox and title on the left, with the importance and number of days remaining on the right. This style reflects what users are used to both in their hand-written todo lists, and in the majority of todo apps. I didn’t want to add any unnecessary complexity to the default task view. Upon clicking a task, however, a user is greeted with more information, such as the exact due date for the task, team members assigned to that task, and comments on that task. We included these features in the expanded task view to help separate work; collaborators for certain tasks are listed at the top of each task for the same reasons that they’re listed at the top of the project; comments allow easy communication on tasks among teammate, while always making them readily accessible and easy to find.<br></div>
      <div class="case-study-inner-title">UI Design</div>
      <div class="case-study-body">With wireframes and use experience decided, I next set out on the user interface design. Just as I asked questions for the experience design, I started this process by asking myself the following:</div>
      <ol class="case-study-list">
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">What emotion and attitude should Amora have? Playful? Serious? Neutral? Calming?</li>
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">How can the UI design help us reach our goal?</li>
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">How can the UI design enhance the user experience?</li>
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">How can color facilitate user flow, while still remaining accessible for everyone?</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="case-study-body">To truly be a collaborative tool, I decided that Amora should be serious, but playful; color should be used to differentiate between projects and tasks, but have enough contrast to still be accessible and usable by all users. <br><br>The UI design went through 2 iterations. The first incorporated the user experience and user flow exactly as the wireframes specified; to be entirely honest, I basically just added color. It was a rather fast iteration to get my ideas on the UI design and to see if the ideas would work. It allowed me to experiment with colors, and which colors to use, icons, shadows, and more.<br></div><img src="images/Messages-Image354319178.png" srcset="images/Messages-Image354319178-p-500.png 500w, images/Messages-Image354319178-p-800.png 800w, images/Messages-Image354319178-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Messages-Image354319178-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Messages-Image354319178.png 1887w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">
      <div class="case-study-body">After walking away from the design for a night, I returned to reiterate on it. Though my goal was to create a playfully serious application, it looked more like company software from the early 2000s. Colors were harsh and did not complement each other; the text was unnecessarily large and the font was too blocky. I still believed that the experience was beneficial and right, so I focused on ensuring the colors, font, and information hierarchy were lightened. I came to the following design:<br></div><img src="images/Desktop.png" srcset="images/Desktop.png 500w, images/Desktop.png 800w, images/Desktop.png 1080w, images/Desktop.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">
      <div class="case-study-body">To reach my goal, I softened the background greys. Adding blue to their hue made them more calming than serious, while still gradually lightening from darker to lighter helps the eye focus on the most important sections of the application. The project colors were lighted and made to be less saturated. This helped them complement each other rather than battle for the user’s attention. I also chose Lato as my font of choice; it not only is on Google Fonts, which decreasing the website’s load time for users, but it has a wide array of font weights. This allowed me to bold the more important information and lighten the less important.<br></div>

    <div class="case-study-inner-title">III) Problems we faced</div>
    <div class="case-study-inner-subtitle">Working with developers to ensure a shared vision of beneficial user experiences</div>
    <div class="case-study-body">I’m a computer science major who is interested in user experience and user interface design. The majority of software engineers, especially those in my group, were more focused on easy development than beneficial user experience and design. Throughout the project, I struggled to convince my group partners that going the extra mile for the user interface design would lead to our best work.<br><br>I learned various strategies to convince them of design’s importance throughout the semester:<br></div>
    <ol class="case-study-list">
      <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point"><strong class="bold-text">Take advantage of Invision</strong> - I began to upload my designs from Sketch to Invision, which easily displayed spacing, font, color, and other specifications in copy and pastable CSS.</li>
      <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point"><strong class="bold-text-2">Maintain regular communication </strong>- Numerous times, the problem wasn’t that the developers didn’t care about the user interface and experience, it’s that they didn’t understand and share my vision for the application. This usually stemmed from ignorance towards the goals, and more specifically, the design lingo that I was using. I found that maintaining communication and keeping them in the loop made my life, their lives, and our user’s lives significantly easier.</li>
      <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point"><strong class="bold-text-3">Listen to their advice</strong> - Though they may not be designers, they use applications regularly and know what to expect. As the only designer on this project, I did not get much of a chance to collaborate with other designers who truly understood the problem we were trying to solve. Oftentimes, the developers stated ideas that were extremely good and beneficial for the project.</li>
