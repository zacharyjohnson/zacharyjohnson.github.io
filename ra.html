    <p class="case-study-inner-title">How have you aided residents in their growth toward self-discovery?</p>
    <div class="case-study-body">As the RA for the Computer Science Learning Community, I&#x27;ve done my best to tow the line between capitalizing on this commonality to build a community while still fostering an environment of individuality and personal growth. I&#x27;ve found that many CS majors get stuck in a rut of &quot;I am a CS major. I need to devote all of my freetime to coding and personal projects. I am worthless if I do not get an internship at a big-name tech company.&quot; It&#x27;s incredibly common in the CS community at Purdue, and it leads to a lot of toxic, competitive clubs and friendships.<br></div>
    <div class="case-study-body less">I&#x27;ve combatted this on my floor with conversations with individual residents while simultaneously devoting a month&#x27;s worth of potty talks to the topic. For a month, I added a section to The Stall Seat Journal titled &quot;You are More than Your Major&quot; where I added tips and tricks and lessons that I&#x27;ve learned throughout my time at Purdue. It encouraged residents to reflect on their hobbies and passions, to find clubs and organizations on campus that fostered these passions, and take advantage of their time in college to grow not only as computer scientists, but people in general. Many residents initially resisted, but I&#x27;ve had numerous conversations with residents who explored new clubs and passions since reading these in the Stall Seat Journal, and I&#x27;ve noticed fewer toxic conversations centered on the previously-mentioned ruts.<br></div>
    <p class="case-study-inner-title">Please provide an example of a time you were a positive role model for your community.</p>

      <div class="w-col w-col-6"><img src="images/IMG_5569.jpeg" srcset="images/IMG_5569.jpeg 500w, images/IMG_5569.jpeg 1080w, images/IMG_5569.jpeg 1600w, images/IMG_5569.jpeg 2000w, images/IMG_5569.jpeg 2600w, images/IMG_5569.jpeg 3200w, images/IMG_5569.jpeg 4032w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 93vw, (max-width: 991px) 45vw, 430px" alt="" class="case-study-image"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study-body">I am very fortunate with the number of opportunities I&#x27;ve had to positively influence the first year CS major experience. One way that was very visible was teaching CS 193, a required class for all first year CS and Data Science majors. I worked with 3 other undergrad instructors to develop the curriculum, hire TAs, enter grades, and take care of every other logistical aspect of teaching a college course.</div>
    <div class="case-study-body">Though this is unrelated to Residential Life, my floor is home to the CS Learning Community. CS 193 was split into two sections, and my residents were in the section that I did not teach. With that being said, I did substitute-instruct their section twice throughout the semester. After teaching my residents, I had numerous folks come and talk to me about how much they enjoyed my lecture and asking for resources to help them find their own opportunities to have an impact on campus. It was an unexpected outcome of teaching the course, and I&#x27;m proud of the leadership and involvement opportunities my residents continually take on campus. </div>
    <p class="case-study-inner-title">Building an inclusively excellent community</p>
    <div class="case-study-inner-subtitle">Accepting Language and Listening</div>
    <div class="case-study-body">I&#x27;ve taken numerous steps to build an inclusive community for all of my residents. To start, before they even arrived, I hung up bathroom signage with gender-neutral language. Additionally, when introducing myself and addressing my residents as a group, I shared my pronouns and used gender-neutral terms like &quot;Everyone&quot;, &quot;Y&#x27;all&quot;, and &quot;Folks&quot;. Throughout the year, I have conversations with residents and listen to their stories, discuss their values and identities, and try to educate myself on actions I can take to keep the community inclusive. </div>
    <div class="case-study-body">I am very fortunate to be the RA for the CS LC. With 95% of my floor being first-year CS majors, they have classes in common, and generally common interests. This helps build the initial connections of community on my floor. I try to host events and have conversations that help my residents dive deeper and discuss different aspects and values so that they feel comfortable being themselves without feeling forced to assimilate to a certain personality, or ignore their own character, to fit in.<br></div>

    </div>
    <div class="case-study-body">For the past three years, I&#x27;ve worked with the other RAs of the CS LC, my faculty fellow, and the CS LCIs to plan a game night in Lawson Commons. I started it as a freshman, working with my RA to plan the event for my floor. For the past two years, I&#x27;ve lead the event for the 3 CS LC floors. It&#x27;s regularly cited as one of our resident&#x27;s favorite events, and gives them a great opportunity to get to know our faculty fellows, LCIs, and Computer Science academic advisors.<br></div>

I hope to be a positive influence in my communities by being open and vulnerable, and encouraging others to do the same. I love devoting my time to building strong relationships that act as the foundation to these communities.<br></div>
