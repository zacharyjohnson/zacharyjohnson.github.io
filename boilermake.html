    <div class="case-study-body case-study---add-margin">I joined the BoilerMake team in January 2018 as a design executive. BoilerMake is Purdue’s annual hackathon; we work to plan a weekend where hundreds of engineers, developers, designers, and entrepreneurs come to Purdue’s campus to create exciting, revolutionary, or funny projects. I was extremely excited to work with the team to build BoilerMake’s theme, branding, website, application, and marketing materials.<br>‍<br>Though the team was exceptionally skilled, I was surprised to find the lack of common practices in their design structure. Designs were generally thrown together based on the theory of “looks good!”; BoilerMake had never created designs based on what leads to the best overall experience for users, let alone a full design system with design standards. I slowly but surely have brought these ideas and changes to the team, and I truly believe it has led to more cohesive design, more organized collaboration, and an overall improved experience for our hackers.<br>‍<br>Check it out our work at <a href="http://www.boilermake.org" target="_blank" class="case-study-body-link">BoilerMake.org</a>!<br></div>

    <div class="case-study-inner-subtitle">Developing design standards and a design system</div>
    <div class="case-study-body">I believe in the power of design systems to create cohesive, collaborative, and continuous designs throughout a product. When I joined BoilerMake’s design team, the process was rigid, allowed for minimal collaboration, and led to every designer creating different designs. After consulting with the other designers, I started the BM-Kit initiative, which allowed me to work with the director, Comm team, and design team to create some standards.<br>‍<br>BM-Kit turned into a set of design standards, a Sketch library, and a React.js framework. Its primary focus was for the website, but it also includes standards for marketing materials. We developed standards for the following: <br></div>
    <div class="case-study-inner-title">Color<br></div>
    <div class="case-study-body">Every component of BM-Kit was developed for easily duplication with the goals of BoilerMake in mind. Our color palette was selected to enhance the feeling of BoilerMake being a fun, creative, energized weekend, while still being general enough to use in a plethora of contexts.<br></div><img src="images/Color-Palette---Labeled.png" srcset="images/Color-Palette---Labeled-p-500.png 500w, images/Color-Palette---Labeled-p-800.png 800w, images/Color-Palette---Labeled-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Color-Palette---Labeled-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Color-Palette---Labeled-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Color-Palette---Labeled.png 2065w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 991px) 96vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">

    <div class="case-study-body">Containers and rules were important, because we decided to use a card-based system for the design; this allowed us to separate important information into groups and structure the website with minimal cognitive load.<br></div><img src="images/Cards.png" srcset="images/Cards-p-500.png 500w, images/Cards-p-800.png 800w, images/Cards-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Cards-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Cards-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Cards-p-2600.png 2600w, images/Cards-p-3200.png 3200w, images/Cards.png 3206w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 991px) 96vw, 900px" alt="">

      <div class="case-study-inner-subtitle">How to simplify the process while still gathering the information we need</div>
      <div class="case-study-body">After the development of BM-Kit, my first task was to implement it with the design of the application. Though a seemingly menial task, I set out to design the application with these goals of BoilerMake in mind:<br></div>
      <ol class="case-study-list">
        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">Get as many completed applications as possible</li>

        <li class="case-study-single-line-bullet-point">Inform applicants our reasoning for collecting the information we do, and make optional information visibly optional</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="case-study-body">My process started by looking through the applications of previous years. The following example is the format the team used. While aesthetically pleasing, it has a large cognitive load - the applicants have numerous directions to look to fill out the fields. Previous years had a large percentage of applicants that missed fields or simply did not finish submitting the application.<br></div><img src="images/Old-Application.png" srcset="images/Old-Application-p-500.png 500w, images/Old-Application-p-800.png 800w, images/Old-Application-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Old-Application.png 1469w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 991px) 96vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">

      <div class="case-study-inner-title">Wireframes</div>
      <div class="case-study-body">After meeting with the design team, we decided to move forward with the single-column design. I started sketching and wireframing how to set up the design. The single-column already solves the problem of the fields left blank and higher number of incomplete applications; now my focus was how to inform the users of why we’re collecting certain information.<br></div><img src="images/Application-Wireframe.png" srcset="images/Application-Wireframe-p-500.png 500w, images/Application-Wireframe-p-800.png 800w, images/Application-Wireframe-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Application-Wireframe-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Application-Wireframe-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Application-Wireframe-p-2600.png 2600w, images/Application-Wireframe-p-3200.png 3200w, images/Application-Wireframe.png 4499w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 991px) 96vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image">
      <div class="case-study-body">I separated the information we’re collecting into various categories; this helps the user keep track of where they are in the application, while also decreasing the cognitive load of a giant group of questions without separation.<br><br>Next, to inform applications as to why we’re collecting certain information, there are two options: display that information by default, or make it incredibly simple for them to find it. I created three variations: one with the information always displayed in a second column, one with the information easily accessible via hovering over a ‘?’ for each section, and one with a ‘?’ for each individual question. Displaying a second column makes the webpage feel off balance and makes the information readily available, but easily missed; displaying a ‘?’ for each section is simple for the view, but makes sorting through the bulk of information difficult for the sections with numerous questions. For those reasons, I moved forward with the third option.<br></div>
      <div class="case-study-inner-title">Final Designs</div>
      <div class="case-study-body">Creating the designs was rather simple after the development of BM-Kit. I used a card to separate the application from the background and illustrations, and used the spacing guidelines to ensure the information hierarchy was the most beneficial it could be. Using BM-Kit, the final design for the application looked like the following:<br></div><img src="images/Final-Application-Design.png" srcset="images/Final-Application-Design-p-500.png 500w, images/Final-Application-Design-p-800.png 800w, images/Final-Application-Design-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Final-Application-Design.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 991px) 96vw, 900px" alt="" class="case-study-image"></div>

    <div class="case-study-inner-subtitle">Using color and illustrations to set the tone for the weekend</div>
    <div class="case-study-body">Our goal for the website and marketing materials was to enhance the BoilerMake brand, and to set the standard that BoilerMake is a fun-filled weekend of creativity and hacking. We browsed numerous illustration styles, and decided to incorporate bold colors; thick, broken outlines, and and incorporate a generally futuristic feel to match our yearly phrase “Forge the Future.” Below are some examples of illustrations and marketing materials that I created for BoilerMake VI. Here are some examples of designs that I created using these principles and the design standards set up in BM-Kit.<br></div>
